Your word is a lamp for my feet, a light for my path. (Psalms 119, 105)

─────────
To love means loving the unlovable.
To forgive means pardoning the unpardonable.
Faith means believing the unbelievable.
Hope means hoping when everything seems hopeless.

─ Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874 – 1936)

─────────
Happiness is the thankful mind for what you have now,
Unhappiness is the greedy mind for what you have not.

Therefore, wealth and fame never guarantee happiness.
Blaming unhappiness on outsides is just an unfair excuse.

─ Thomas Júne Park
